What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* I felt very confident coming into the GPS but I was struggling with defining each action. I think it is important to better understand the theory and meanings behind the actions we are performing. The GPS helps a lot to better ground me on the why. 
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* Git Add
* Git Commit
* Git Push
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* Not too sure I remember exacty but what I do remember was that I wanted confirmation from my pair and guide when I was lost or stuck and that was certainly reassuring to have the people there to guide me. 
What still confuses you about Git?
* Nothing. I am very clear on all aspects. 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* It was a great. Nervous at first but Katy was super chill (as was our guide) and it was a great experience!
